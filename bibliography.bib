  ABSTRACT={Deep learning has become the most widely used approach for cardiac image segmentation in recent years. In this paper, we provide a review of over 100 cardiac image segmentation papers using deep learning, which covers common imaging modalities including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound and major anatomical structures of interest (ventricles, atria, and vessels). In addition, a summary of publicly available cardiac image datasets and code repositories are included to provide a base for encouraging reproducible research. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations with current deep learning-based approaches (scarcity of labels, model generalizability across different domains, interpretability) and suggest potential directions for future research.}

In particular, the paper first reviews predictive modeling concepts relevant to cardiology such as feature selection and frequent pitfalls such as improper dichotomization. Second, it discusses common algorithms used in supervised learning and reviews selected applications in cardiology and related disciplines. Third, it describes the advent of deep learning and related methods collectively called unsupervised learning, provides contextual examples both in general medicine and in cardiovascular medicine, and then explains how these methods could be applied to enable precision cardiology and improve patient outcomes.}

  abstract = "In recent decades, heart disease threatens people's health
              seriously because of its prevalence and high risk of death.
              Therefore, predicting heart disease through some simple physical
              indicators obtained from the regular physical examination at an
              early stage has become a valuable subject. Clinically, it is
              essential to be sensitive to these indicators related to heart
              disease to make predictions and provide a reliable basis for
              further diagnosis. However, the large amount of data makes manual
              analysis and prediction taxing and arduous. Our research aims to
              predict heart disease both accurately and quickly through various
              indicators of the body. In this paper, a novel heart disease
              prediction model is given. We propose a heart disease prediction
              algorithm that combines the embedded feature selection method and
              deep neural networks. This embedded feature selection method is
              based on the LinearSVC algorithm, using the L1 norm as a penalty
              item to choose a subset of features significantly associated with
              heart disease. These features are fed into the deep neural
              network we built. The weight of the network is initialized with
              the He initializer to prevent gradient varnishing or explosion so
              that the predictor can have a better performance. Our model is
              tested on the heart disease dataset obtained from Kaggle. Some
              indicators including accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score
              are calculated to evaluate the predictor, and the results show
              that our model achieves 98.56\%, 99.35\%, 97.84\%, and 0.983,
              respectively, and the average AUC score of the model reaches
              0.983, confirming that the method we proposed is efficient and
              reliable for predicting heart disease.",

               Diagnosing of the heart disease is one of the important issue
